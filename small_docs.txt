function "delete_comment_answer"
    recive: 
        request
        entry_id - for get topic_id and in the end passed as parameters for redirect
        comment_id - id of entire document that contain needed comment
        answer_id - id of the required comment that should be deleted

    1) get comments_collection from mongodb
    2) get entire document that contain needed comment
    3) get first_lvl comments when every item is dictionary
    4) a function call "find_and_delete_answer" that returns edited comments without deleted
        How works this function:
            Functon catch list of answers when every item is dictionary.
            Every item can have itself answers

            Functin recive:
                answers - list of answers when every item is dictionary
                answer_id - comment id that should be deleted
            First of all we rese to zero index. Index needs for delete currect comment

            1) Takes every element of list of answers
            2) Checks the condision.
                if "id" of list element equal "id" of neede comment:
                    delete elemet from list of answers
                    break
                else:
                    Checks the condision.
                        Does element have itself answers list
                        If yes:
                            called the same function "find_and_delete_answer" that gets answers list that belongs current element
                            break
                        else:
                            pass
            3) Index += 1
            4) Returns list of answers without deleted comment

    5)
